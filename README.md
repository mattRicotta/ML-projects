# ML-projects
## Machine Learning Playground

This is my first forray into machine learning with Python. I also plan to get practice using Jupyter Notebooks to work through my code.

### Packages In Use:
* Jupyter Labs (obvs!)
* Matplotlib (for graphing)
* Numpy (for datasets; included with Jupyter)
* Scikit-Learn (ML library)

To create the environment, install the requirements.txt `pip install -r requirements.txt`
